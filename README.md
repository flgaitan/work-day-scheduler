# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

- What was your motivation?
The motivation for this project was to complete a work day schedule agenda using the elements learned this week. some of these elemets include jquery, boostrap and moment().format().

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
This porject was built upon the knowleadge collected and showing that not only do we know the advantage that the above concepts provide for us as developers, but making sure that we are applying them in the correct way to bring functionality to our work day scheduler.

- What problem does it solve?
The project solves the organizational needs of a person that needs to visually see their day planned out.

- What did you learn?
Through this project I learned how to work around the code that was given and actually recognize the elements I needed to add to complete the code. We have had similar projects before but this is actually the first time where I felt like I looked at everything carefully and started working with what I recognized. This was a big step for me because it shows me growth and it was great feeling a little less lost than other projects.
